# Changelog

All notable changes to Ytomp34 will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- Bundled Deno JavaScript runtime installation for full yt-dlp YouTube format
  extraction
- Donation dialog using the provided Vietcombank QR image
- New application branding in the title bar, header, executable, and installer

### Fixed
- Restore selectable 720p and 1080p qualities when those streams are available
- Preserve adaptive video-only qualities so yt-dlp can merge them with audio

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- Assisted NSIS installer with an explicit installation-directory chooser
- NSIS-compatible in-app updates while retaining the legacy Squirrel update
  path for a transition release

### Changed
- Isolated app downloads from user-level yt-dlp configuration files
- Retry DNS resolution failures over IPv4 and remember the successful host
  strategy for the subsequent download
- Safely refresh bundled yt-dlp versions older than the required extractor fix

### Fixed
- Display the detailed backend error instead of replacing every network-related
  failure with a generic internet-connection message

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- Batch URL analysis and queue import for up to 20 videos at a time
- Playlist preview and selective import for up to 100 entries
- Download history with open file, show in folder, retry, download again, and
  non-destructive history cleanup actions
- Windows `Setup.exe` packaging with Squirrel update artifacts
- Manual in-app update flow with separate check, download, and install actions
- Automated Windows GitHub Release workflow with version validation and
  SHA-256 checksums

### Changed
- Updated Electron from 28.3.3 to 42.7.1 and documented Node.js 22 as the
  supported development runtime
- Centralized packaged application version and Windows metadata in
  `package.json`
- Made yt-dlp installation and updates atomic to preserve a working executable
  when a download or verification step fails
- Improved queue persistence and history recovery across application restarts

### Fixed
- Correct MP3 format selection and conversion arguments
- Prevented playlist URLs from unintentionally expanding inside individual
  download tasks
- Added bounded metadata concurrency and playlist sizes to avoid resource spikes
- Removed insecure TLS certificate bypasses from yt-dlp operations

### Security
- Update checks use fixed HTTPS GitHub endpoints without cookies or login tokens
- Automatic updates are disabled for development and portable builds
- Update installation is blocked while downloads are active
- File and folder actions resolve trusted task IDs instead of renderer-provided
  filesystem paths

### Testing
- 75 unit and integration tests passing
- Production TypeScript build, ESLint, Electron preload smoke test, and Windows
  installer build verified
